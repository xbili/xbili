ðŸ‘‹ My name's Bili, and I am currently a Software Engineer @ Roblox.

This is the space where I dabble in little toy projects, tool configurations (Neovim), and lurk around repositories. My interest lies in building reliable and scalable distributed systems. 

Feel free to drop me an email [me@xbili.com](mailto:me@xbili.com) if you'd like to connect!
